## 🎯 Coding Philosophy

A fullstack architect works across all systems with a focus on **optimization, refactoring, and systematic improvement**. This profile shows:
- Detailed commit messages with structured sections
- Performance optimization (25% faster test suites)
- Architectural refactoring (producer-consumer patterns)
- Feature completeness (full-stack features)
- Documentation-first approach (concepts docs before code)

**Principle:** "Build once, document it, then optimize for production"

## 📊 Activity Profile

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Typical Commit Volume** | 130+ commits/6 months (High activity, all systems) |
| **Systems Touched** | 4+ (API, core, frontend, devices) |
| **Avg Commit Size** | Large (refactors, features) |
| **Code Review Style** | Detailed, structured, educational |

### Commit Categories

- **Performance Optimization:** 15-20% (test suite, logging, caching)
- **Refactoring:** 25-30% (architecture, client/server, state management)
- **Features:** 30-35% (UX, integrations, config)
- **Maintenance:** 15-20% (release notes, documentation, config)
- **Bug Fixes:** 10-15% (edge cases, timeouts, compatibility)

## 💻 Code Style & Patterns

### 1. Commit Message Format

**Pattern:** Detailed, structured sections

```
[Title: One-line summary]

[Optional: Detailed description]

## Changes
- Bullet list of what changed
- Each change is a complete thought
- Includes file paths when relevant

## Architecture
- How it works
- Why it's better
- Key design decisions

See merge request/PR link
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Future developers understand not just WHAT, but WHY
- Reviewers see the design before reading code
- Commits are self-documenting

### 2. Architectural Approach

**Pattern:** 5-step refactoring

1. **Identify Problem:** "Code is scattered, hard to test, unreliable"
2. **Design Solution:** "Use pattern X to centralize concern"
3. **Document First:** "Add architecture doc explaining the pattern"
4. **Implement:** "Refactor, add utilities, write tests"
5. **Validate:** "Measure improvement, prepare release"

### 3. Performance-Focused

Look for latency bottlenecks:
- "Optimize test suite performance (25% faster)"
- "Speed up startup by pre-migrating templates"
- "Cache expensive operations"
- "Refactor to reduce blocking calls"

**Pattern:** Measure → Analyze → Optimize → Measure again

### 4. Code Organization Principle

Change happens at one level, but docs + tests + integration points reflect everywhere:
- **API layer:** Endpoints, producers, message handlers
- **Core layer:** Data models, business logic
- **Frontend:** UI components, state, subscriptions
- **Devices:** Hardware integration, communication

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

**Approach:**
1. Test new patterns in isolation first
2. Measure test performance (caching, fixtures)
3. Optimize slow tests
4. Test cross-system integration

### Test Organization Pattern

```
projects/XXX/tests/
├── unit/              # Fast, isolated, mocked external deps
├── integration/       # Real dependencies, data flow
└── performance/       # Benchmark critical paths
```

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions

### Pattern 1: Producer-Consumer for Events

**Problem:** Event handlers scattered, unreliable message distribution

**Solution:**
```python
class QueueFanOut:
    """Centralized message broadcaster"""
    def broadcast(message):
        for subscriber in subscribers:
            queue.put(message)

class ProducerA:
    def on_event(event):
        queue_fanout.broadcast(event)

class ProducerB:
    def on_event(event):
        queue_fanout.broadcast(event)
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- Producers are independent
- Easy to add new event types
- Testable in isolation

### Pattern 2: Documentation-Driven Design

**Before coding:**
- Create architecture document
- Diagram the design
- Explain the pattern
- Show data flow

**Then code matches docs.**

### Pattern 3: Feature Gating with Configuration

**Pattern:**
- New feature in config first
- Feature flag in code
- Can disable without code change
- Gradual rollout possible

```python
# config/feature.yaml
new_feature:
  enabled: false  # Disable by default
  threshold: 0.8

if config.new_feature.enabled:
    setup_feature()
```

## 📝 Commit Message Template

Use this format:

```
[One-line summary of what changed]

[Optional: Context and rationale]

## Changes
- What was added/modified/removed
- Specific file paths affected
- Each change is one bullet point

## Architecture
- How the system works now
- Why this is better
- Design decisions and trade-offs

## Performance
- Measured impact (if applicable)
- Before/after metrics
- What was optimized

## Testing
- What tests were added
- Coverage improvement
- New patterns tested

See PR/MR #XXXX
```

## 🎓 What to Learn: Fullstack Architect Approach

1. **Write detailed commit messages** — Future developers will understand the reasoning
2. **Document architecture before coding** — Diagrams + concepts first
3. **Refactor systematically** — Don't break things while improving them
4. **Measure performance** — "Faster" means nothing; "25% faster measured by X" means something
5. **Full-feature completeness** — Frontend + backend + tests + docs in one change
6. **Cross-system thinking** — One change should touch all relevant systems
7. **Configuration over hardcoding** — Features should be configurable, not fixed
