Verify code quality by running tests, linting, and type checking.

Scope defaults to `all` unless specified: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Steps

1. **Determine scope** from arguments:
   - `backend` — Python only
   - `frontend` — TypeScript/Node only
   - `all` or empty — both

2. **Run checks in order** (stop on first failure, report clearly):

   **Backend:**
   ```bash
   just test-backend
   PYTHONPATH=projects/backend uv run mypy projects/backend/package
   uv run pyright projects/backend/package
   uv run ruff format --check projects/backend
   ```

   **Frontend:**
   ```bash
   just test-frontend
   cd projects/frontend && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run prettier:check
   ```

   **All:**
   ```bash
   just test
   just typecheck
   just lint
   ```

3. **On failure:** Read the error output, identify the root cause, and report:
   - Which check failed
   - Which file(s) and line(s)
   - A short suggestion for fixing

4. **On success:** Report concisely — e.g., "All checks passed (tests, types, lint)."
